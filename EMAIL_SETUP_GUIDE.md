## Costs

### Free Tier (Plenty for Most Cases!)

- **Supabase:** 500,000 Edge Function calls/month
- **Resend:** 100 emails/day (3,000/month)

### If you exceed free tier:

- **Resend:** $20/month for 50,000 emails
- **Supabase:** No extra cost (500K is huge)

**For a typical media agency:**
- 10-50 form submissions/month
- Well within free tier!

---

## Alternative: Workflow Automation

Instead of Supabase Edge Functions, you can use:

### Make.com / Zapier / n8n

1. Connect to Supabase
2. Trigger: New row in `contact_inquiries`
3. Actions:
   - Send email
   - Add to Google Sheets
   - Create CRM entry
   - Send Slack message
   - Whatever you want!

**Pros:**
- No coding needed
- More flexibility
- Many integrations

**Cons:**
- Limited free tier
- Slightly slower than Edge Functions
