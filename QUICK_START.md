## 🚀 Step-by-Step Process

### ⭐ YOU HAVE A FIGMA DESIGN - USE THIS WORKFLOW:

**See `FIGMA_TO_LOVABLE_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions!**

### Step 1: Export Figma to Lovable (5 minutes)
1. Install Builder.io plugin in Figma
2. Select your design (use Auto Layout!)
3. Click "Open in Lovable"
4. **Estimated cost: 3-5 credits**

### Step 2: Add Backend Features (2 minutes)
1. In Lovable, prompt: "Connect to Supabase and add authentication"
2. Prompt: "Create admin dashboard for content management"
3. **Estimated cost: 2-3 credits**

### Step 3: Connect Supabase (2 minutes)
1. In Lovable: Settings → Integrations → Connect Supabase
2. Select project: `dghlytwuslldhogqscho`

### Step 4: Connect GitHub (3 minutes)
1. In Lovable: Click GitHub icon
2. Create repo: `nextgenmedia-web`
3. Let Lovable sync

### Step 5: Clone to Local (1 minute)
```bash
cd C:\Users\Pedro\Desktop\nextGenmedia_web
git clone YOUR_GITHUB_URL .
```

### Step 6: Let Claude Code Take Over (0 credits!)
Tell me: "I've cloned the Figma-imported repo!"

Then I'll:
- ✅ Fix visual quirks from Figma import
- ✅ Set up environment variables
- ✅ Install dependencies
- ✅ Apply database migrations
- ✅ Create storage buckets
- ✅ Generate TypeScript types
- ✅ Run security checks
- ✅ Match design exactly to your Figma
- ✅ All at ZERO Lovable credits!
