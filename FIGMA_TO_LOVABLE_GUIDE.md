# Figma to Lovable Guide - NextGen Media Agency

## üé® You Have a Figma Design - Perfect!

Since you already have your media agency website designed in Figma, we'll use the **Figma ‚Üí Builder.io ‚Üí Lovable** workflow to convert it to code efficiently.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

### In Figma:
- ‚úÖ Your media agency design is ready
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Use Auto Layout for best results
  - Apply Auto Layout to all parent containers
  - Set proper padding, margins, and alignment
  - Name layers clearly (e.g., "Header", "Hero Section", "Portfolio Grid")

### Tools Needed:
- Builder.io Figma plugin (free)
- Lovable account
- GitHub account

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Install Builder.io Plugin (2 minutes)

1. Open your Figma file
2. Go to Plugins ‚Üí Browse plugins in Community
3. Search for "Builder.io - Figma to Code"
4. Click "Install"

**Plugin URL:** https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/747985167520967365

---

### Step 2: Prepare Your Figma Design (5-10 minutes)

**Quick Checklist:**

‚úÖ **Use Auto Layout**
- Right-click containers ‚Üí Add Auto Layout
- Ensures responsive layouts work properly

‚úÖ **Name Layers Clearly**
- Good: "Header", "CTA Button", "Portfolio Grid"
- Bad: "Frame 1", "Rectangle 2", "Group 15"

‚úÖ **Organize Pages**
- Homepage
- Portfolio/Projects
- Services
- About
- Contact
- Admin Dashboard (optional - can add later)

‚úÖ **Export Mode**
- **Easy Mode**: Fast export, good for quick starts
- **Precise Mode**: Pixel-perfect, takes longer

**Recommended:** Start with Easy Mode, refine with Claude Code later

---

### Step 3: Export to Lovable (5 minutes)

1. **Select Your Design**
   - Click on the main frame/page in Figma
   - Run Builder.io plugin (Plugins ‚Üí Builder.io)

2. **Configure Export**
   - Choose "Easy Mode" for speed
   - Select framework: React (default for Lovable)
   - Check "Include responsive settings"

3. **Open in Lovable**
   - Click "Open in Lovable" button
   - Lovable will create a new project
   - Wait for code generation (30-60 seconds)

4. **Review Generated Code**
   - Lovable will show your design as working code
   - Check if layout matches your Figma design
   - Note any visual quirks (Claude Code will fix these later)

**Credits Used:** ~3-5 credits for initial import

---

### Step 4: Add Backend Functionality in Lovable (2-3 credits)

Now enhance your static design with dynamic features:

**Prompt 1:** (Paste in Lovable chat)
```
Connect this project to Supabase. Add authentication with login/signup pages.
Create database tables for: projects, services, testimonials, team_members,
and contact_inquiries. Make the contact form save submissions to the database.
```

**Prompt 2:** (If you want admin features)
```
Create an admin dashboard at /admin (protected route) where authenticated
admins can:
- Add/edit/delete portfolio projects
- Manage services and testimonials
- View contact form submissions
- Upload images for projects

Include proper authorization checks.
```

**Credits Used:** ~2-3 credits for backend setup

---

### Step 5: Connect Supabase (2 minutes)

1. In Lovable, go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations
2. Click "Connect Supabase"
3. Authorize Lovable
4. Select project: `dghlytwuslldhogqscho`
5. Confirm connection

---

### Step 6: Connect GitHub & Export (3 minutes)

1. Click GitHub icon in Lovable
2. Authorize GitHub access
3. Create new repository: `nextgenmedia-web`
4. Let Lovable push the code
5. Copy your GitHub repo URL

---

### Step 7: Clone to Local (1 minute)

```bash
cd C:\Users\Pedro\Desktop\nextGenmedia_web
git clone YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL .
```

---
